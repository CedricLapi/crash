        <p style="color: purple">We use CSS to add style to our HTML documents.</p>
        <p>There are a few different ways to add CSS to a document, but for time being we'll be using <em>inline</em> CSS.</p>

        <h2 style="background-color: aquamarine; color: black; text-align: center;">Inline CSS</h2>
        <p>Inline CSS is written directly in our HTML using a style attribute.</p>
        <p>We can style any element using inline styles, from the body to headings and paragraphs,
            <a href="#" style="background-color: blanchedalmond; color: brown;">as well as links</a> and strong and em tags too!
        </p>
        <p>CSS is always written in property value pair and separated by a colon ; and the value is always followed by a semicolon</p>
