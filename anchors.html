        <h1>Linking between pages</h1>
        <p>Adding links is very easy to do! We use <a href="https://google.com">anchors</a> to link one page to another,
             and we tell it what page to link to using attributes.</p>

        <p>Return to <a href="index.html">homepage</a></p>

        <h1>Anchors</h1>
        <p>We use the anchor tag to setup hyperlinks. When a user clicks on the hyperlink,
             it will bring them to the specified location, which could be within the same page, or to another page. </p>
